# Error Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Service Worker MIME Type Error
**Problem**: `The script has an unsupported MIME type ('text/html')`
**Cause**: Netlify was serving `/sw.js` as HTML (404 page) instead of JavaScript
**Fix**: 
- Disabled service worker registration in `main.jsx` (not needed for this app)
- Added `_redirects` file to properly handle service worker requests
- Added proper 404.html page

### 2. ✅ Chrome Extension Errors
**Problem**: Uncaught errors and unhandled promise rejections in content script
**Cause**: Extension making API calls without proper error handling
**Fix**:
- Added global error handlers to `content.js` and `background.js`
- Created `makeAPICall` utility function with timeout and better error handling
- Added AbortController for request timeouts (10 seconds)
- Improved error messages and logging

### 3. ✅ Sentry Rate Limiting
**Problem**: `429 (Too Many Requests)` to Sentry error reporting
**Cause**: Too many errors being sent to Sentry
**Fix**: 
- Fixed underlying errors to reduce error volume
- Added error prevention in extension scripts

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend/src/main.jsx` - Disabled service worker registration
- `frontend/public/_redirects` - Added Netlify redirect rules
- `frontend/public/404.html` - Added proper 404 page

### Extension
- `extension/content.js` - Added global error handlers
- `extension/background.js` - Added error handling and API utility function

## Expected Results

After these fixes:
1. ✅ **No more service worker errors** - SW registration is disabled
2. ✅ **Fewer extension errors** - Better error handling and timeouts
3. ✅ **Reduced Sentry spam** - Fewer errors being generated
4. ✅ **Better user experience** - Graceful error handling instead of crashes

## Testing

To verify the fixes:
1. **Check browser console** - Should see fewer errors
2. **Test extension** - Should handle API failures gracefully
3. **Check Netlify deployment** - Service worker requests should return 404 instead of HTML
4. **Monitor Sentry** - Should see reduced error volume

## Additional Improvements Made

### Error Handling Utility
Created `makeAPICall()` function with:
- ⏱️ 10-second timeout
- 🔄 Automatic retry logic
- 📝 Better error messages
- 🛡️ AbortController for request cancellation

### Netlify Configuration
- 📁 Proper file serving rules
- 🚫 404 handling for missing resources
- 🔄 SPA fallback routing

### Extension Robustness
- 🛡️ Global error boundaries
- 📝 Comprehensive logging
- ⚡ Graceful degradation

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** to see the fixes in action
2. **Monitor error logs** to ensure issues are resolved
3. **Test extension functionality** to verify everything works
4. **Check analytics** to ensure they're loading properly

The application should now be much more stable with better error handling throughout!
